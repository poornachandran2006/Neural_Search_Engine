Neural Search Engine – Test Document

This is a sample text file created to test the ingestion pipeline
of a Neural Search Engine system.

The goal of this document is to verify the following aspects:
1. TXT file loading
2. UTF-8 text reading
3. Metadata extraction
4. Text chunking and overlap handling
5. Embedding generation and storage in a vector database

Neural search systems use embeddings instead of keyword matching.
These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of text and are stored
inside a vector database such as Qdrant.

When a user asks a question, the query is converted into an embedding.
The system then performs a similarity search to retrieve the most
relevant document chunks based on semantic meaning.

This test document is specifically used to evaluate whether
the neural search engine can correctly retrieve relevant information
from a small dataset using semantic search techniques.

The document helps validate that user questions such as:
"What does the test document verify?"
or
"Explain the ingestion pipeline test document"
can retrieve meaningful answers from the stored content.

End of document.
